Starting this article with a big disclaimer, I‚Äôm no data scientist. Honestly, I‚Äôm terrible at math. I never studied past high school geometry, of which I scraped by with a D-. With that said, all of my techniques for analyzing data could be absolute shit.

Similar to my janky qualifications, I don‚Äôt think any company that I‚Äôve worked for has had great practices around data collection and analysis. Usually, data is a black box‚Äîwhich is weird since we are living in the era of ‚Äúdata-driven decision making‚Äù.

In reality, most people just reference some data shit someone else has found or said‚Äîwith no idea how to do it for themselves or the specific thing that they are working on. Below, we‚Äôre going to change that.

## Why knowing how to get data is important

For the longest time, this was me too. I would inform the work I was doing with a Google search that lead me to websites like [Nielsen Norman](https://www.nngroup.com/). To understand how my work performed, I relied on an engineer or a marketer to track stuff down and drop knowledge. Often, data that would be helpful just wasn‚Äôt there or it was too high-level to directly correlate it to a specific design choice.
