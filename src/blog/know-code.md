summary: This article advocates for designers to learn coding to bridge the gap between design and development, streamline the production process, and foster innovation. It emphasizes the importance of designers understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to prototype ideas rapidly and communicate effectively with developers, arguing that a hybrid skill set leads to more cohesive digital products.

Welp, you've heard this all before—and yet, it is still peaking your interest. If you find yourself here, **not knowing code,** could that itself be an indication of uncertainty toward the quality <span class="space:nowrap">of current</span> skillset? Could _simply_ learning to code qualm that fear?

<mark>My guess is yes.</mark> But beyond that, we're designing screens... These designs are being built with... Code. Fundamentally, wouldn't it make sense to understand the medium in which we're designing in?

Wouldn't have always made sense? Like, we wouldn't want to hire an architect that doesn't understand the implications of the little drawings that they are making, so why was it ever ok that a screen designer doesn't understand code?
