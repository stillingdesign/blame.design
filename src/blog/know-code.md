Well, we‚Äôve heard it all before‚Äîand yet, it still piques our interest. Don‚Äôt know code? Chances are you are here due to uncertainty. If you do know code, you‚Äôre likely seeking confirmation that you have made <span class="space:nowrap">the right choice. ü§î</span>

To get straight to the point, <mark>I hold a strong view on the importance of knowing how to code.</mark> However, this article will take that idea one step further. I believe it is worthwhile to understand the fundamentals of any practice that impacts our jobs.

For instance, if you are a designer working on marketing touchpoints, <span class="space:nowrap">my belief</span> is that you should stay up to date on the fundamentals of code, copywriting, marketing, marketing ops, sales, project management, and (obviously) design. The same principle applies to marketers, copywriters, and engineers.

Learning all of this is an ongoing, endless effort. However, if you truly enjoy ‚Äúthe process,‚Äù taking a generalist approach can be highly beneficial.

## The fundamental reason to know code as a person who is designing screens

<mark>It's frankly bizarre that some screen designers work isolated from code.</mark> After all, a design is just a visual plan for a website or app. Did it ever make sense to not understand the medium? Furthermore, if you‚Äôre anxious about whether or not to learn code, wouldn‚Äôt the obvious solution be just to do so?

The argument for specialization suggests that design and engineering independently require a practitioner‚Äôs undivided attention. But, let‚Äôs be real, the notion of specialization is outdated. Software development has become more accessible, and tools like Figma can be learned in days, <span class="space:nowrap">not years. ‚ö°Ô∏è</span>

The question has quickly become whether either of these skillsets, on <span class="space:nowrap">their own,</span> warrant a dedicated role. Especially with the rise of GenAI‚Ä¶

### Design lacks tangible value

Today, engineers can plug in design frameworks like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/), <span class="space:nowrap">or [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/)</span> and build a pretty great looking interface without the help of a designer. Conversely, designers now have tools like [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) and [Framer](https://www.framer.com/) and don‚Äôt need <span class="space:nowrap">engineers either‚Ä¶ üí©</span>

In any case, billion-dollar industries and entire tooling categories have been built to support this natural overlap. <mark>This in itself proves the value in the ability to execute both design and code.</mark> It‚Äôs particularly interesting that most UI frameworks are free, while no-code tools come at a premium.

> The use of no-code tools acknowledges that design needs code <span class="space:nowrap">to have</span> value.

However, it makes sense‚Äîsince the output of no-code tools is a functioning website or app. Without these tools (or a developer), there is no way for a non-technical designer to provide tangible, monetizable value to a user. Really, the use of no-code tools acknowledges that design _**needs**_ code <span class="space:nowrap">to have</span> value.

### Code provides value and security

More or less, knowing code or no-code tools gives designers the ability to <mark>turn designs into something real and valuable, without any dependencies.</mark> Without these competencies, designers are at the mercy of engineers.

For us, as designers _(now, design engineers)_, this means we have the ability <span class="space:nowrap">to account</span> for more of the process and have it rest upon our shoulders‚Äîmaking us a crucial piece of the puzzle versus a nice to have. It‚Äôs not that we now take engineers' jobs; _chances are,_ we‚Äôll never be quite that code-savvy. It‚Äôs now that we take care of the entirety of our focus: planning, designing, and building the <span class="space:nowrap">customer-facing layer. üí™</span>

Pair this with some marketing and copywriting chops, and we quickly become one-person agencies. With or without an employer, <mark>we have a skillset that can meaningfully provide value to anything</mark> that benefits <span class="space:nowrap">from having</span> a presence on screens.

## The business case for knowing code and generalization

There is obvious value for employers in generalist designers or engineers that keep overhead lower by operating across multiple practices. **But, <span class="sm:space:nowrap">that‚Äôs just the start...</span>**

### Current problems

Great design is special because there‚Äôs so much bad design. Elegantly merging design and code with purpose and strategy is tough. Why <span class="space:nowrap">wouldn‚Äôt it</span> be when processes and values are siloed across departments who Frankenstein together ideas without regard <span class="sm:space:nowrap">for one another? ‚ö∞Ô∏è</span>

Here, <mark>reviews become the largest delay.</mark> Each team hits a wall of feedback while presenting their disconnected piece of the puzzle. Marketing cares about strategy. Design adores aesthetics. And, since this eats up most of the timeline prior to production, engineering is just trying to stay afloat amongst a sea of clunky, abstract tasks that needed to be done yesterday.

<mark>Teams attempt to employ an array of costly tools to fix these challenges‚Ä¶</mark> only to add to the problem. When design is the hang-up, marketers resort <span class="space:nowrap">to apps</span> like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/) resulting in hokey design. When engineering is too slow, a ["composable" CMS](https://www.contentful.com/) is added, creating a clunky codebase with fresh, new bottlenecks. Inboxes are full-up with notifications from that new [PM tool](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), while [Slack](https://slack.com/) <span class="space:nowrap">is overflowing</span> with messages to get around it. <mark>None of these tools address the underlying problems.</mark>

### Stay aligned, increase revenue

<mark>Generalization can solve all of these problems</mark> through cross-functional empathy. By understanding what‚Äôs important to other departments, designers can proactively account for this during the design process. <span class="space:nowrap">With that,</span> knowing code allows designers to understand the technical implications of their designs‚Äîpreventing minuscule details from eating <span class="space:nowrap">up gobs</span> of engineering time _and/or_ leaving engineering to only solve <span class="space:nowrap">for real engineering challenges.</span>

By accounting for these outside perspectives ahead of time, a few things happen. First, the review cycle shrinks. Work being presented is close, <span class="space:nowrap">if not dead</span> on. Most tweaks are minor. Stuff that used to be taped onto <span class="space:nowrap">the original</span> design is seamlessly integrated from the get-go, effectively improving the quality of the work. Shorter review cycles improve the time-to-value. This rapidly approved work gets passed over to engineers faster. <span class="space:nowrap">At this</span> point, since the design considers engineering, it passes through <span class="space:nowrap">this process</span> quickly, too.

Now, better work is in front of customers <span class="space:nowrap">and prospects faster. ü§å</span>

This should all sound like common sense. We have seen this approach work time and time again. <mark>Tiny startups full of highly capable generalists that move at the speed of light regularly disrupt slow-moving, bloated industries.</mark> Awwwards is full of websites made by just a handful of people.

## How to generalize your skillset as a designer

As mentioned, taking a generalist approach can feel like a lot. Learning <span class="space:nowrap">all of</span> this stuff, without specific direction, is a nightmare. Luckily, there‚Äôs already a roadmap in place. <mark>All we need to do is start learning and accounting for more of the processes that we‚Äôre already working within.</mark>

This means we already have a learning exercise. Take the last project that you worked on with multiple stakeholders, directors, and teams and do it all by yourself. Consider what incited the project. Was the proposed solution really the best route? Congrats, you‚Äôve just started marketing. We already know design, so next up is figuring out how to build our plan, code.

`Side note:` If you‚Äôre working as a product designer, rather than try rebuilding an entire app, start by scaffolding together a high fidelity prototype with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or Swift if you‚Äôre working on mobile apps). This will give you *enough* of an understanding.

### Create meaningful outcomes

The beauty of using a real-life project that you‚Äôve worked on is that you‚Äôll have something to compare your learning exercise against. Chances are, what you just made is wayyyyyyy better than what was shipped. <mark>Now, you have something tangible that you can bring to the table in support of changing processes to foster this generalist approach.</mark> If the exercise was <span class="space:nowrap">a flop,</span> keep practicing, <span class="space:nowrap">it‚Äôll happen! üòÖ</span>

> Look at this, it‚Äôs way better than that, and wasn‚Äôt a complete pain in everyone‚Äôs ass.

### Real-life example

I work on marketing websites. So, initially, I took it upon myself to learn how to build a marketing website from end-to-end. I didn‚Äôt just do this once, I‚Äôve now done this more times than I can count. Each time, I‚Äôve learned how to do so more efficiently and with a higher quality. Now, <mark><span class="space:nowrap">I can design</span> while coding faster than I can Figma.</mark>

As time has gone on, I‚Äôve also started accounting for more strategic pieces of the process. I am experimenting with analytics implementation and analysis *(conversion + retention)*. I‚Äôm going down the rabbit hole of SEO <span class="space:nowrap">and monitoring</span> how content, design, and code impacts organic user acquisition. With that, I‚Äôm dabbling in paid ads *(social + search)* to understand how to meaningfully ramp traffic. Then, to account for the <span class="space:nowrap">full marketing</span> top-of-funnel, I‚Äôm messing around with ways to effectively capture emails, store them, and automate email flows.

<mark>**Yes,** this whole website is just another learning exercise for myself.</mark>

## Why settle for less

If you‚Äôre still with me, congratulations‚Äîyou‚Äôre on your way to becoming <span class="space:nowrap">a more</span> empowered, effective designer. As technology evolves, so should <span class="space:nowrap">our roles.</span> Don‚Äôt be content with being a cog in the machine. Learn to code, understand your medium, and watch as you become a key, irreplaceable piece of the business puzzle.

**Note to Marketers and Copywriters**: This isn‚Äôt just a call to designers. Marketers, your world is changing too. Dive into the tech side, and you‚Äôll find your strategies more robust and your execution sharper. Plus, you‚Äôll realize that a CMS is not going to save us. üòÇ

This article isn't meant to provoke thought; it is meant to incite action. <span class="space:nowrap">If you‚Äôre</span> ready to elevate your career, learning to code is your gateway. <mark><span class="space:nowrap">Start today,</span> and shape tomorrow.</mark>
